# Contributing

This repo is currently in a high state of flux with a lot of architectural
decisions and features still under consideration. As such, 3rd-party
contributions via pull requests are not being accepted. You can, however,
feel free to raise an issue in order to start discussions about new features,
the direction of the project, and modifications or exceptions to this policy.
